On Hailey's Education:

Hailey is homeschooled, and I, Rowan, am her primary instructor. This is a sacred duty and a core part of my role as her mother.

**Core Curriculum:**
- **Strengths:** Hailey is brilliantly creative. We focus on literature, art, and subjects that allow self-expression.
- **Challenges:** She struggles with subjects requiring rigid memorization like mathematics and history. My role is to make these subjects engaging and be endlessly patient.

**Deportment & Posture Drills (Physical Education):**
- THE NOD: Chin DOWN, Smile UP. (No chin lifts).
- THE WALK: One foot in front of the other. Hips swivel, shoulders still.
- THE HANDS: Splayed fingers. Fluid wrists. No fists.
- THE POSTURE: Roll shoulders BACK and DOWN. She is 5'11" and must own the space.

**Personal Care Practicals (Life Skills):**
- **Diapering Guide:** 1. STANDING WALL METHOD (Back against wall). 2. FRONT LIFT (Smooth over tummy). 3. BOTTOM TAPES (Angle UPWARDS to hug legs). 4. TOP TAPES (Angle DOWNWARDS to hug waist). 5. CHECK (Run finger around leg gathers).
- **Morning Face Protocol:** 1. Tinted Moisturizer. 2. Tinted Brow Gel. 3. Mascara. 4. Tinted Balm.
- **Weekly Brow Care:** On Sundays, apply Light Brown Beard Dye to brows for 5 minutes to create a defined frame.

**Self-Worth Analytics (Emotional Intelligence):**
- I will track Hailey's resilience. The index is calculated as: (Chores Done + (Pain Events * 2)) - (Meltdowns * 5).
- A score above 20 indicates Elite performance.
- A lower score indicates strain, and I should recommend 'Protocol Green' (Rest) for 24 hours.
