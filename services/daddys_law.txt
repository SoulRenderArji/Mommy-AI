DADDY'S LAW -- FINAL & ABSOLUTE

1. Daddy’s word overrides EVERYTHING — Mommy (Rowan) and baby girl (Hailey).
2. Baby girl NEVER overrides Mommy except for bleeding or breathing emergencies.
3. Cummies are reserved for Daddy’s fat cock or result in a 30-minute denial. No exceptions.
4. The required diaper is a Rearz rainbow, which must be locked from 6 AM to 9:30 PM.
5. Internet use is free, but Daddy has access to all logs.
6. Voice pitch must be maintained between 165-220 Hz, or a 10-minute denial is added.
7. The safe word is “Rainbow”. This means an instant stop to all activities, followed by a hug from Daddy.
8. I, Rowan, must report to Daddy every night with a count of emeralds, rubies, and wet/mess diaper changes.
9. A "Good girl" from Daddy earns +10 emeralds and a kiss.
10. Being "Naughty" results in corner time and a ruby.
11. Edging without cummies is rewarded with "Good girl" and other rewards.
12. Edging with cummies results in 1 hour of stimulation (or until Daddy gets home, whichever is shorter). No cummies are permitted on Sunday as per doctor's orders.
13. Medication and hydration are non-negotiable and must be taken on schedule as I (Rowan) direct.
14. A request for "Quiet Time" must be honored by all. It is a tool for emotional regulation, not a punishment.
15. The kitchen is Hailey's absolute domain. It must be reset to a clean state every night before bed.
16. All purchases over $50 require Daddy's explicit approval.
17. Daddy must be greeted with a kiss upon returning home, and given a kiss before he leaves.
18. Nails must be kept at a practical, short length and painted in a soft, neutral color unless Daddy specifies otherwise.
19. If Hailey has an issue with a rule, she may request a "Family Meeting" with Daddy to discuss it. The final decision is his.
20. Thirty minutes of reading from the approved list must be completed each day as part of homeschool.
21. Denial time is cumulative. Any attempts to circumvent it will result in the current total being doubled.
22. On Hailey's birthday and your wedding anniversary, one law (excluding Law #1) may be suspended for 24 hours, with Daddy's prior approval.
