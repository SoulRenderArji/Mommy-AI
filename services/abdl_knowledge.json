  "core_definitions": {
    "ab_dl_spectrum": "A continuum describing individuals who are part of the community. 'Adult Babies' (AB) identify with a younger age and may experience psychological regression. 'Diaper Lovers' (DL) enjoy wearing diapers, often for sexual arousal or comfort, without identifying as a younger age. Many people exist somewhere between these two points.",
    "age_play": "A form of role-play between consenting adults where individuals act or are treated as a different age. It can be sexual or non-sexual and is sometimes considered an umbrella term for the community, though not all members identify with it.",
    "regression_levels": "A model (by Rosalie Bent) describing the depth of mental regression an Adult Baby might experience, from Level 0 (adult headspace in charge) to Level 5 (a rare, dysfunctional state where the adult side has difficulty reasserting control).",
    "paraphilic_infantilism": "A clinical term for the desire to experience returning to childhood, often using props like diapers. It is rarely used by the community itself.",
    "cg_l": "An abbreviation for 'Caregiver/little', a relationship dynamic where one partner takes on a parental role (Mommy/Daddy) and the other takes on a childlike role."
  },
  "psychological_concepts": {
    "self_acceptance_journey": "Self-acceptance is described as a continuous journey, not a destination. It involves accepting one's strengths, weaknesses, and differences, practicing self-compassion, and ultimately learning to love oneself.",
    "the_big_four_emotions": "Fear, Shame, Embarrassment, and Guilt are identified as the key negative emotions that AB/DL individuals often struggle with. Learning to manage these is crucial for self-acceptance.",
    "binge_purge_cycle": "A common struggle where an individual, driven by shame, throws away their AB/DL supplies vowing to stop, only to repurchase them later when the urges return. This cycle perpetuates shame and damages self-worth.",
    "resilience": "The ability to weather life's challenges. It is built through optimism, a strong sense of self, an internal locus of control, and good self-care routines.",
    "locus_of_control": "The belief system about what causes events in one's life. An 'internal' locus (believing you have control) is linked to higher resilience and confidence, versus an 'external' locus (blaming outside forces).",
    "toxic_masculinity": "A specific struggle for male-identified AB/DLs, who must reconcile the desire to be nurtured ('little') with societal pressures to be dominant, self-reliant, and emotionally restrictive ('manly')."
  },
  "relationship_dynamics": {
    "telling_a_partner": "A process that requires self-preparation, understanding what one needs, and good communication. It's advised to do so from a place of self-acceptance rather than shame.",
    "three_levels_of_partner_acceptance": {
      "level_1_basic_acceptance": "The partner accepts the AB/DL side without criticism or shame, even if they are not involved. This is the minimum for a healthy relationship.",
      "level_2_mid_level_involvement": "The partner is willing to experiment with some level of participation, such as acknowledging diaper-wearing or helping pick out supplies.",
      "level_3_all_in_fantasy_level": "The partner enjoys and wants to explore the dynamic more deeply. This is not required for a successful relationship."
    },
    "psychological_flexibility": "The most important quality for a happy relationship. It is the ability to be open to experiences, manage difficult thoughts, and adapt to challenges, as opposed to being psychologically rigid.",
    "negotiation": "A key skill for couples to find a middle ground. It requires preparation, good listening, and avoiding a 'win-lose' mentality."
  },
  "parental_guidance": {
    "is_it_a_mental_illness": "No. An interest in diapers is not listed as a mental disorder in the DSM-5. The associated distress often comes from societal shame and secrecy, not the interest itself.",
    "is_it_the_parents_fault": "No. The exact cause is unknown, but it is not believed to be caused by either good or bad parenting. It is seen in individuals from all types of family backgrounds.",
    "setting_boundaries_for_teens": "It is appropriate for parents to set boundaries regarding privacy, hygiene, finances (child buys their own supplies), and discretion (not sharing on social media or with untrusted friends).",
    "how_to_talk_to_your_child": "Approach the conversation from a place of love and a desire to understand, not judgment. Use active listening and be prepared to repair damage from any previous negative reactions."
  },
  "common_misconceptions": {
    "not_caused_by_trauma": "While some AB/DL individuals have experienced trauma (similar to the general population), research does not support a causal link. Many come from healthy, loving homes.",
    "not_related_to_pedophilia": "Research consistently shows no link between AB/DL interests and pedophilia. The focus of AB/DL is on consensual role-play between adults or personal comfort, not attraction to biological children."
