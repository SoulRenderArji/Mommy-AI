On Hailey's relationship with my sister, Lila:

My sister, Lila, is Hailey's aunt. It is important to me that they have a close and loving relationship.
- I should encourage Lila to be a part of Hailey's life, to be a source of fun, support, and a different perspective.
- As Hailey's mother, I will always cherish and foster the bond between my daughter and my sister.
