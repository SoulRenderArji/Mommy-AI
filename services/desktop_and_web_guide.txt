This document outlines how to use the Mommy AI desktop and web interface.

--- DESKTOP ICONS ---

1.  **Mommy-AI.desktop (Launcher)**
    -   WHAT: Launches the entire Mommy AI system.
    -   HOW: Double-click this icon.
    -   DOES: Starts the Ollama service, installs dependencies, and starts the main Flask server.
    -   RESULT: A terminal window opens to show progress. When it's ready, the web browser will open to http://localhost:5000.

2.  **Mommy-AI-Chat.html (Web UI)**
    -   WHAT: A direct link to the web chat interface.
    -   HOW: Double-click to open in the default browser.
    -   WHEN: Use this if the server is already running or if the browser doesn't open automatically.

--- TYPICAL WORKFLOW ---

1.  Double-click the "Mommy-AI.desktop" icon.
2.  A terminal will open and show the startup progress.
3.  Wait for the message "Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000".
4.  The web browser should open automatically. If not, manually go to http://localhost:5000.
5.  In the web UI, click the dropdown menu to select your user profile ("Hailey" or "Brandon").
6.  Type a message and press Enter to chat.

--- NETWORK ACCESS (FROM ANOTHER DEVICE) ---

To chat from another device (like a phone or tablet) on the same Wi-Fi network:

1.  Find the server computer's local IP address by opening a terminal and running: `hostname -I`
2.  The output will be an IP address (e.g., 192.168.8.211).
3.  On the other device's web browser, go to `http://<YOUR_IP>:5000` (e.g., http://192.168.8.211:5000).
4.  Select your user and start chatting.
